Dear Kind Marker


NOTE: I changed my file system when I was nearly finished with this assignment and after I did that it seemed like a part of my git log is not showing anymore. Well to me at least. I hope this does not effect my mark because I have been doing many small iterations to the program.

## Files included :

1. assignment1.h = header file
2. assignment1.cpp = source file 
3. assignment1driver.cpp =  driver file

##How to Run the project

You would need to place any txt files you want the program to test into the same diretory as the program.

The menu will indicate which file is currently active if any.

When inputing a tag Name for 'l' you can either just put the tag name and note that it is case sensetive.

Compiling: make
Running: make run
